                        In a Make-to-Order scenario, once Sales Orders are
                        received from a customer, subsequent Planned Orders and
                        Production Orders are generated against it. It may
                        happen that in the meanwhile, another Sales Order for
                        the same product and/or spares with same configuration
                        is received from a Premium customer. In such a scenario,
                        the Sales agents need to have the flexibility to divert
                        an existing order to the premium customer to enable
                        faster delivery to him. To do so, a Sales agent taking
                        the order needs to check beforehand if there is any
                        product already in pipeline for another Sales Order. If
                        yes, the agent can commit a shorter delivery date and
                        create a Sales Order with the same.

                        F1 race drivers have to take critical decision of
                        stopping at the pit for repairs and part replacements
                        during a race. This decision sets them back a few
                        critical seconds but it is important to have the car in
                        good condition to run optimally till the finish line.
                        The vital stats that must be available to the driver at
                        all times are as follows:
                        <br />• Current Speed <br />• Fuel left & Tank Capacity
                        <br />• Tire condition (How many km it can run without
                        tire wearing off) <br />• Engine Heat <br />• Next Pit
                        distance <br />• Distance to Finish line <br />• Gap
                        between the driver and race leader, etc. <br />It is
                        imperative for a driver to take this tough decision
                        multiple times during a single race. Correct decision
                        making can prove to be the difference between winning
                        and losing.

                        There is an automobile manufacturing company that deals

                        high setup and maintenance time leading to loss of
